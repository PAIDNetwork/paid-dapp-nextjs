<p class="western" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="color:#000;">(a) <u><strong>Network Launch</strong></u>. If there is a Network Launch before the expiration or termination of this instrument, the Company will automatically issue to the Purchaser a number of units of the Token equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Discount Price.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="color:#000;">In connection with and prior to the issuance of Tokens by the Company to the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 1(a):</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="color:#000;">(i) The Purchaser will execute and deliver to the Company, or to a third-party service provider if requested by the Company, any and all other transaction documents related to this SAFT, including verification of non-U.S. person status under the applicable securities laws; and</p>
