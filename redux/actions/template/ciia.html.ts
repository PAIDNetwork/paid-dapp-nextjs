<ol type="a">
<li>
<p style="color: black;"><u><strong>Governing Law</strong></u><strong>.</strong> The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of <span style="background-color:#f79632">{{#stateOfCompany}}{{stateOfCompany}}{{/stateOfCompany}}{{^stateOfCompany}}[STATE]{{/stateOfCompany}}</span>, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="color: black;"><u><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></u><strong>.</strong> Except as described in Section&nbsp;2., this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and Consultant relating to its subject matter and merges all prior discussions between the parties to this Agreement. No amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties to this Agreement. The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any rights or remedies it may have in law or equity, nor to have given any authorizations or waived any of its rights under this Agreement, unless, and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company. Any subsequent change or changes in Consultant&rsquo;s duties, obligations, rights or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="color: black;"><u><strong>Successors and Assigns</strong></u><strong>.</strong> This Agreement will be binding upon Consultant&rsquo;s successors and assigns, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="color: black;"><u><strong>Notices</strong></u><strong>.</strong> Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such party&rsquo;s address as set forth on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice, or if no address is specified on the signature page, at the most recent address set forth in the Company&rsquo;s books and records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="color: black;"><u><strong>Severability</strong></u><strong>.</strong> If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected. The Company and Consultant have attempted to limit Consultant&rsquo;s right to use, maintain and disclose the Company&rsquo;s Confidential Information, and to limit Consultant&rsquo;s right to solicit employees and customers only to the extent necessary to protect the Company from unfair competition. Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section&nbsp;8. exceeds the maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the parties intend that the court should reform, modify and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time. In the event that any court or government agency of competent jurisdiction determines that, notwithstanding the terms of the Consulting Agreement specifying Consultant&rsquo;s Relationship with the Company as that of an independent contractor, Consultant&rsquo;s provision of services to the Company is not as an independent contractor but instead as an employee under the applicable laws, then solely to the extent that such determination is applicable, references in this Agreement to the Relationship between Consultant and the Company shall be interpreted to include an employment relationship, and this Agreement shall not be invalid and unenforceable but shall be read to the fullest extent as may be valid and enforceable under the applicable laws to carry out the intent and purpose of the Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="color: black;"><u><strong>Remedies</strong></u><strong>.</strong> Consultant acknowledges and agrees that violation of this Agreement by Consultant may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore Consultant agrees that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, Consultant agrees that a $1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="color: black;"><u><strong>Advice of Counsel</strong></u><strong>.</strong> CONSULTANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, Consultant Has HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND Consultant Has read and understands ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="color: black;"><u><strong>Counterparts</strong></u><strong>.</strong> This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Execution of a facsimile copy will have the same force and effect as execution of an original, and a facsimile signature will be deemed an original and valid signature.</p>
